### Added

- Admin endpoint `POST /api/v1/events/{event_uuid}/reminders` to queue manual event reminder emails.
- Notification type `manualEventReminder` with audience presets:
  - `default` — same recipients as the automatic two-day reminder (active and paused members with `subscribed = 1`).
  - `no_answer_active` — active members with no participation answer.
  - `no_answer_active_paused` — active and paused members with no participation answer.
  - `members` — explicit list of member UUIDs.
- Shared helper `sendReminderEmailsToMembers` for automatic and manual reminder delivery.

### Changed

- Refactored upcoming-event reminder sending in the scheduler to use the shared delivery helper.
